My main research interests lie in optimisation algorithms: their real-world
applications and how they perform on a wide range of problems with different
structures.

In algorithm performance analysis, I have a particular focus on linear and
mixed-integer programming methods. These problem formulations can be applied to
many optimisation problems in transport, power generation and distribution, and
network design (to name a few). My work focuses on generating test cases which
effectively stress-test optimisation algorithms and determine their relative
strengths and weaknesses, enabling algorithm selection and automated
configuration methodologies to improve algorithm performance.

My applied work is currently focused on analysing passenger and freight movement
in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. We aim to improve understanding of the potential
role of rail transport in the region by applying mixed integer programming and
decomposition methods to solve logistics problems.
