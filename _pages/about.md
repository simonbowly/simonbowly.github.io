My main research interests lie in optimisation algorithms: their real-world applications and how they perform on a wide range of problems with different structures.

In algorithm performance analysis, I have a particular focus on linear and mixed-integer programming methods. These techniques apply to many optimisation problems in transport, power generation and distribution, and network design (to name a few). My work focuses on generating test cases that effectively stress-test optimisation algorithms and determine their relative strengths and weaknesses, enabling algorithm selection and automated configuration methodologies to improve algorithm performance. 

My applied work focuses on analysing passenger and freight movement in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. We aim to understand the potential role of rail transport in the region by applying mixed-integer programming and decomposition methods to solve logistics problems.
